# CompetencyDataMining

This repo is part of the "Competency.se" project from the Refugee Tech hackathon that was held in Stockholm, feb 6-7 2016. The data mining part is used to experiment with various open data sources available in Sweden (and possibly abroad as well).

In short, the code written here is used to import data into ElasticSearch.
